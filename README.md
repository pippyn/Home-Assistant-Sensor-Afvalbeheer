This is a list of fractions you want a sensor for. At least one option is required. Not all fractions work with all collectors.
Main resources options:
  - restafval
  - gft
  - papier
  - pmd

Some collectors also use some of these options:
  - gftgratis
  - textiel
  - glas
  - grofvuil
  - asbest
  - apparaten
  - chemisch
  - sloopafval
  - takken
  - pbd
  - duobak
  - restwagen
  - sortibak

### Postcode
Postcode is required and is your own postcode

### Streetnumber
Streetnumber is required and is your own street number

### Suffix
```yaml
suffix: a
```
Optional streetnumber suffix

### Streetname
```yaml
streetname: ?
```
Streetname is only required for Ophaalkalender.be and Limburg.NET

### Cityname
```yaml
cityname: ?
```
Cityname is only required for Limburg.NET

### Print all available waste fractions
```yaml
printwastetypes: 1
```
If you set this option the sensor will print a list of all possible waste fractions for your address and waste collector on every restart of your HA system.

### Upcoming sensor
```yaml
upcomingsensor: 1
```
If you activate this option you'll get 2 extra sensors (today and tomorrow) which are handy for automations.
The today sensor will display the fractions collected today.
The tomorrow sensor will display the fractions collected tomorrow.
Default is 0.

### Date format
```yaml
dateformat:
```
If you want to adjust the way the date is presented. You can do it using the dateformat option. All [python strftime options](http://strftime.org/) should work.
Default is '%d-%m-%Y', which will result in per example:
```yaml
21-9-2019.
```
If you wish to remove the year and the dashes and want to show the name of the month abbreviated, you would provide '%d %b'. Which will result in:
```yaml
21 Sep
```

### Date only
```yaml
dateonly: 1
```
If you don't want to add dayname, tomorrow or today in front of date activate this option. Default is 0.

### Day of week
```yaml
dayofweek: 1
```
This option adds the name of the day to the state of the sensor when the date is within 7 days. Default is 1.

### Day of week only
```yaml
dayofweekonly: 1
```
This option removes the date from the sensor if `dayofweek` is active. Default is 0.

### Always show day
```yaml
alwaysshowday: 1
```
This option removes the 7 day limit of `dayofweek`. Default is 0.

### Date object
```yaml
dateobject: 1
```
If you want the sensor state to be a date-time object. Default is 0 (state as string).

### Name
```yaml
name: 'your custom name'
```
If you want a custom name to be added to the sensor name. By default, no name is added. This is especially useful when you configure more than one sensor using this platform.

### Name prefix
```yaml
nameprefix: 0
```
If you don't want to add the waste collecoctors name to the sensor name. Default is 1.

### Built in icons
```yaml
builtinicons: 1
```
If you don't want to use the icons from your waste collector you can use the built in icons. Default is 0.
For now only these fractions are supported:
- gft
- gftgratis
- glas
- papier
- pmd
- pbd
- restafval

### Disable the use of entity_picture
```yaml
disableicons: 1
```
If you want to assign MDI icons (in your customize section) to these sensors, you'll need to set this option to 1.

### Translation
```yaml
dutch: 1
```
If you want to display the names of the days in dutch. Default is 0.

### Update interval
```yaml
updateinterval: 12
```
If you want to adjust the update interval, you can set this option to the desired hours. Default is 1.
